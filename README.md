# What is this repository ? 

This repository stem from a school project I have worked on in the INSA Centre-Val de Loire in 2022. 

The only instruction for this project was to **modeling the tendency of Covid19 using AI**. More specifically, using Linear Regression and LTSM Neural Network.

I have chosen to study France's official data and so, for the need of this assignement, I've cleaned the original database in order to create a usable one for an IA. You can find the original data in [this file](table-indicateurs-open-data-dep-2022-04-03-19h00.csv). Also the modified database is [Dataframe_clean.csv](). 

You can find a full report on this project [clicking here](Rapport.md).
